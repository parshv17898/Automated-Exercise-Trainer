# Automated-Exercise-Trainer

The model which is focused towards Exercise is an automated exercise trainer model which takes the video of the person performing the exercise and which guides the doer in doing so. It is equipped with detection and classification of exercise. It also provides feedback in terms of score which will help the doer in assessing his/her work. A small feedback with what improvement he/she can do in the posture is also included in the feedback. The repetition count is also provided in case of exercises like push up and other such repetitive exercises.

The Automated Exercise Trainer model includes the pose estimation, exercise detection, classification and correction of exercises, extraction of body angles, scoring of exercises based on performance and calculation of various other parameters such as Rep Count. This project makes the use of various libraries and machine learning algorithms. The model is trained for a long time to get the desirable output. The Openpose library is used for the human pose estimation. This is a single person human pose estimation model using openpose library. Dynamic Time Warping algorithm is also used for calculation of the distance between testing video and training videos. This algorithm is used for 2D Pose Estimation as well as 3D Pose Estimation. Various machine learning and deep learning techniques and algorithms are used to implement this project.
