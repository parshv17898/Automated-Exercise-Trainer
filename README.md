# Automated-Exercise-Trainer

The model which is focused towards Exercise is an automated exercise trainer model which takes the video of the person performing the exercise and which guides the doer in doing so. It is equipped with detection and classification of exercise. It also provides feedback in terms of score which will help the doer in assessing his/her work. A small feedback with what improvement he/she can do in the posture is also included in the feedback. The repetition count is also provided in case of exercises like push up and other such repetitive exercises.
